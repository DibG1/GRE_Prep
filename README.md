# GRE_Prep
A repository to help students prepare for the GRE

My scores:

GRE: 329, 4.5 AWA

167Q+162V

Key takeaway: There are multiple strategies for solving GRE problems, ample practice will tell you which one works best for you.

Magoosh Premium subscription is a very useful paid resource, I highly recommend taking it. 

For Verbal: First do Manhattan Verbal Strategies followed by the 5 lb for practice.
Follow it with the Princeton Review Verbal Workbook and if you have time use the other resources.
Finally, do the official ETS Verbal workbook

For Quants: Start with the Manhattan 5 lb for practice
Finally, do the official ETS Quant workbook

Once you have completed the books, solve the official ETS GRE Powerprep book.

Mock tests:
While preparing for the GRE, give the mock test periodically to know where you can improve and focus your preparation on those areas.
Give the ETS PP1 midway in your preparation and ETS PP2 just a week before the actual GRE. These two test scores are the most accurate measure of your actual score.
Apart from these you can give mock tests on:
Magoosh: It is totally worth it to take the Premium subscription
Manhattan: 1 free mock test
Princeton: Use the ISBN number from amazon to access their paid mock tests for free by registering on their website
